        text: "<p>After teaching English abroad for over 10 years, I've decided that it was time to take a leap and make a career change. I discussed my life change with my family and friends and decided to embark on becoming an UX designer. I feel that with my experience as a teacher and my overall interests and skills, I will be a very effective designer. </p><p> I studied and received my User Experience Certification at UCLA Extension. In the UCLA UX program I have worked on various projects and real-world case studies that have prepared me for a future career the field. Along with UX design, I was also able to learn UX research, Content Strategy, and took a frontend coding bootcamp to broaden my skillset.</p><p> I am currently working freelance on two different projects for small companies to gain some experience before embarking into a bigger opportunity. Through the freelance work, I am able to practice the methodology I learned and experience real-world situations and issues that I didn't encounter in classes.</p><p> I am ready to start this new chapter in my life and am excited to work in UX!",
